## Experimental - Adwaita Styled Theme for XFWM4

This is an Adwaita "port" for XFWM4 made with screenshots from Gnome applications. It has a few issues the most notable of which is that the top corners look awkward above dark backgrounds.

### Installation

Run `make install` in the project directory, then select 'xfwaita' from XFCE window manager settings under the style tab.

### Uninstallation

Run `make uninstall` in the project directory.

### License

The same license as Gnome.
