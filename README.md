### Installation

Run `install.sh` in the project directory, then select 'Xfwaita-dark' from XFCE window manager settings under the style tab.

### Uninstallation

Run `uninstall.sh` in the project directory. Don't forget to select a different theme from settings before you log out.

### Off-centered title workaround

To work around the slightly off-centered window title, place an equal number of window buttons on the left and right sides of the title. For example, if you have the close, maximize, and hide buttons on the right side, you can put the menu, stick, and shade buttons to the left side from XFCE window manager settings. Or try a fork of XFWM4 that supports full-width title centering.

### License

The same license as Gnome.
